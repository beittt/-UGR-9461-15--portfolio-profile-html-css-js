        <p>I completed my high school education at Lideta Catholic Cathedral School in 2014 (Ethiopian Calendar) / 2022 (Gregorian Calendar) with outstanding academic achievements. During my time there, I excelled in subjects such as Mathematics and Sciences, which laid the foundation for my passion for technology. Beyond academics, I was an active member of the Literature Club, where I honed my creative writing and public speaking skills, and the Science Club, where I participated in innovative projects and competitions that nurtured my analytical and teamwork abilities.</p>

        <p>I am currently a 3rd-year Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa University, where I am working towards completing my degree by 2027. My studies focus on developing expertise in areas such as Web Development, Data Structures, and Software Architecture, with a strong emphasis on practical problem-solving and innovation. I have been actively involved in collaborative academic projects that address real-world challenges using modern software technologies. Additionally, I participate in extracurricular activities such as university-level Tech Clubs and programming competitions, which have enhanced my technical and leadership skills.</p>

        <p>Over the years, I have obtained several certifications that complement my academic journey. I earned a UI/UX Design Certificate from The Knowledge Academy, where I mastered skills in designing user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces using tools like Figma and Adobe XD. Through Coursera, I completed an Advanced Web Development course, which deepened my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, enabling me to create dynamic and responsive websites. Additionally, I hold an official Cisco Certified Networking Associate (CCNA) certification, which equipped me with a solid understanding of networking fundamentals, including LANs, WANs, IP Routing, and security, as well as hands-on experience in configuring and troubleshooting Cisco network devices.</p>
